# Inventory-Manager-Lite

ðŸ“¦ Inventory Manager Lite
Inventory Manager Lite is a simple, single-page web application designed to help you track product stock, manage reorder levels, identify out-of-stock items, and record sales. It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for functionality.

ðŸ’¡ Concept
This application provides a straightforward way to keep an eye on your product inventory. You can easily add new products, update existing ones, track their current stock, and get alerts when stock levels are low or depleted. The newly added sales feature allows you to deduct stock directly from your inventory.

ðŸ”§ Features
Add/Edit/Delete Inventory:

Add new products with a name, category, initial stock, and a reorder level.

Edit existing product details directly from the inventory list.

Delete products from your inventory with a confirmation step.

Stock Management (New!):

Record Sales: A dedicated section to select a product and enter the quantity sold, automatically deducting from the current stock.

Real-time stock updates reflected in the inventory list.

Reorder Alerts:

Products with a stock level at or below their defined reorder level are highlighted in yellow.

Products that are completely out of stock (stock = 0) are highlighted in red.

Search by Category:

Quickly filter your inventory list by entering a category name in the search bar.

Download your entire inventory data as a CSV file for external use or record-keeping.
